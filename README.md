## TURTLE TAIL
# Project overview and features
This project is a game that can play 2 players. Player one is a painter. The painter will draw the picture following the word that shows on the screen by the limited time by dragging the mouse then player 2 is a challenger will guess the word from the picture. Finally, the program will report the score. 


In this program, I use 5 classes. First is the "Stage class" to set the loading page, receive the user information, and prepare the turtle. Next is the "Word class" which is the class that read the CSV file and return the list of question. Next is the "Setting class" which is the class that use to play the game in one round. Next is the "Report class" which is the class that reads the score file then returns the score. Finally is the "Mix class" which is class that use to mix all of the classes into one attribute and show the leaderboard.
